We'd love for you to contribute and to make this project even better than it is today! If this interests you, please make sure to follow the steps below before creating a Pull Request.

Before accepting any Pull Request, we would like to remind you to follow the following steps:

1. Ensure all dependencies are within your project (JS, CSS etc)

2. Ensure you have JS Linted your changes, I will provide a JS Lint config file eventually, there should be no errors.

3. Do your best to stick with the coding style (I know you won't like it, but if you do, great)

4. If you completed step 1 and 2, then the final step would be to proceed with your Pull Request
